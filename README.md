    > 1. ex1-finite-difference.vtk
      Typical solution of the finite-difference method, where the solution is constant on each CELL (square) of the mesh.
      
    > 2. ex2-line.vtk
      Given a set of points (on a curve), plot the line joining them.

    > 3. ex3-line2.vtk
      Given a set of points on a circle, plot straight lines joining them.
      
    > 4. ex4-finite-difference2.vtk
      An example of a finite-difference solution (vector velocity and scalar pressure), where the CELLS are squares and the solution is constant on each CELL.
